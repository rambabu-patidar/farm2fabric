					<h1>Wear Wool, Not Fossil Fuel</h1>
					<p>
						Every 25 minutes, an Olympic-sized pool of oil is used to make
						synthetic clothing. Textiles - such as polyester, nylon and acrylic
						- are a highly reliant product group made from fossil fuel. 100%
						natural, renewable and biodegradable, Merino wool can help you to
						buy less and buy better. Wool is a renewable and biodegradable natural
						fiber, aligning with sustainability goals and eco-friendly textile 
						practices. Wool plays a crucial role in Indian culture and traditions. 
						It is used to create traditional textiles, shawls, carpets, and other 
						handicrafts, preserving cultural heritage.
